       "'Just finishing the book now, and I have some very mixed feelings about it so far. I have one of the doc\\'s other books, and I do love how he tackles each subject with such focus and detail, and backs it up with science whenever possible. And he does have a lot of data to support his claims, as well as citing some very interesting studies.<br />First off, I\\'m surprised to see so many glowing, 5-star reviews. I know a lot of people who\\'ve attended his seminars are reviewing the book, but this whole process takes a lot of time and practice. In the book, he makes it sound like this will be a relatively quick, easy process, and I think he is setting up people for frustration and failure. As an experienced meditator myself, I can say I\\'ve only achieved the state he says you need to be in to do most of this work, a few times ever. And I\\'ve been meditating seriously for 10 years. He says we need to become \"pure consciousness. No thing, no one, no where, no time. Completely take our awareness out of our physical bodies.\" Ohhhh no problem! Sure, I\\'ll do a four day seminar and do that, or I\\'ll read the book and do that. He also says you need to be able to \"think greater than you feel.\" which in context means that, when you are visualizing the future you want, you have to be able to create great feelings of joy, gratitude, etc. which are more powerful than whatever limiting belief or horrible body sensation you may currently be feeling due to disease, depression, etc. Again, WOW. This is a HUGE, HUGE task, and will take a LOT of time to achieve.<br />In addition, his whole process is very focused on the outcome. You will achieve this or that if you do this meditation or that one. He spends almost no time in the book on talking about the importance of general mindfulness, or meditating just for the process itself, and exploring your own mind. He has, of course, stories of people who\\'ve cured themselves of all sorts of horrid illnesses. So how could we, the reader, not be focused on the outcome when he\\'s shoving the outcome down our throats on every page? This is why they rarely talk about stuff like this in buddhism, because then you will be focused on that, and not the process itself. You will get distracted by your new abilities, or frustrated when you don\\'t acquire them.<br />Now, is everything he\\'s saying in this book possible? Sure, it\\'s POSSIBLE. I can\\'t prove it isn\\'t. And I do believe humans are divine at our core. But is it PROBABLE that it will happen? Not without SERIOUS commitment, time, and determination. For every person who says they achieved amazing results after only one meditation or one weekend seminar, there are probably at least a hundred who didn\\'t.<br />After spending some time on Joe\\'s forums and his Facebook group, I can see other people agree with me that parts of the book are a little confusing or difficult. I see numerous questions being asked about one of the meditations, alone. I also see a lot of people are frustrated with the process, because it\\'s not working like he says it should. I\\'m only mentioning all of this because I feel the reviews currently are very one-sided. If you go into this without any perspective, you will be greatly frustrated and disappointed.<br />With all my doubts and skepticism, I truly hope I am wrong, and I am forced to eat some serious crow. I welcome it. I have a lot of health issues, both mental and physical, that I\\'m dealing with, so there\\'s plenty of opportunity to use these methods. I will attack this with patience and determination, and will update my review at a later date if appropriate.'"
